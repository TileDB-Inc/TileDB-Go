This package provides [TileDB](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB) golang bindings via cgo. The bindings have been
designed to be idomatic Go. `runtime.SetFinalizer` is used to ensure proper
free'ing of C heap allocated structures.

## Installation

### Supported Platforms

Currently the following platforms are supported:

-   Linux
-   macOS (OSX)

### Prerequisites
This package requires the TileDB shared library be installed and on the system path. See the
[official TileDB installation instructions](https://docs.tiledb.com/main/solutions/tiledb-embedded/installation)
for installation methods. TileDB must be compiled with serialization support enabled.

### Go Installation

To install these bindings you can use `go get`:

```bash
 go get -v github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Go
```

To install package test dependencies:

```bash
go get -v -t github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Go
```

Package tests can be run with:

```bash
go test github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Go
```

## Compatibility

TileDB-Go follows semantic versioning. Currently TileDB core library does not,
as such the below table reference which versions are compatible.

## Missing Functionality

The following TileDB core library features are missing from the Go API:

- TileDB generic object management
- TileDB group creation

## Deprecated Functionality

### 0.21.0

The query methods `(Set)?Buffer(Var|Nullable|Var|Unsafe)*` are deprecated because the corresponding
TileDB core methods are removed. The methods will be supported for 2 releases and are expected to be
removed in release 0.23. It is recommended to use the proper combination of
`(Set|Get)DataBuffer`, `(Set|Get)ValidityBuffer` and `(Set|Get)OffsetBuffer`.

### 0.23.1

The query methods `(Add|Get)?Range` are deprecated because they are deprecated in TileDB core.
It is recommend to use the `Subarray` type for building queries.
The methods will be removed in the release following their removal from TileDB core.

### 0.24.0

`Array.DeleteFragments` is deprecated in favor of `tiledb.DeleteFragments` which binds to
`C.tiledb_array_delete_fragments_v2` the preferred method to delete fragments in TileDB 2.18.0.
