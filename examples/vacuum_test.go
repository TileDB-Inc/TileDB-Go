 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * When run, this program will create a simple 2D sparse array, write some data
 * to it, write again and read num of fragments. Then read from array,
 * consolidate and again read num of fragmens. Then vacuum and read number of
 * fragments.Finally will read from array to verify data read are the same as
 * in first read
 *
