 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This is a part of the TileDB tutorial:
 *   https://docs.tiledb.io/en/latest/tutorials/writing-dense.html
 *
 * When run, this program will create a simple 2D dense array, write some data
 * to it in global layout, and read the entire array data back. Here we show
 * how to handle the case where some tile extent does not divide the respective
 * dimension domain (and, hence, internal domain expansion occurs).
