ABSTRACT

We present a novel storage manager for multi-dimensional
arrays that arise in scientific applications, which is part of a larger
scientific data management system called TileDB. In contrast to existing
solutions, TileDB is optimized for both dense and sparse arrays. Its
key idea is to organize array elements into ordered collections called
fragments. Each fragment is dense or sparse, and groups contiguous
array elements into data tiles of fixed capacity. The organization into
fragments turns random writes into sequential writes, and, coupled with
a novel read algorithm, leads to very efficient reads.  TileDB enables
parallelization via multi-threading and multiprocessing, offering
thread-/process-safety and atomicity via lightweight locking. We show
that TileDB delivers comparable performance to the HDF5 dense array
storage manager, while providing much faster random writes. We also
show that TileDB offers substantially faster reads and writes than the
SciDB array database system with both dense and sparse arrays. Finally,
we demonstrate that TileDB is considerably faster than adaptations of
the Vertica relational column-store for dense array storage management,
and at least as fast for the case of sparse arrays.
